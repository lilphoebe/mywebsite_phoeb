At the request of the (fictional) Chinook online music store, I'll be using
R and SQL to analyze their company's proprietary database and answer important 
questions about sales, employee performance, and future marketing strategies. I'll use the {RSQLite} package to make SQL queries to the Chinook database.

The code & queries used to generate each section of this report are folded into collapsible sections.
For more details about how I designed a particular query, just hit "Code".

First, I'll load the necessary packages to manipulate data in R, and create SQL 
queries from the comfort of RStudio. Then I'll make two "helper functions" - one
to list the tables in the Chinook database to make sure the connection is working,
and one I'll use to connect to the database, retrieve the queried data, and securely close the connection.

#### Preparing the Database:
```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(RSQLite)
library(DBI)
library(RColorBrewer)
```
```{r warning=FALSE, comment=FALSE,results=FALSE}

db <- 'chinook.db'
run_query <- function(que)
{
  conn <- dbConnect(SQLite(), db)
  result <- dbGetQuery(conn, que)
  dbDisconnect(conn)
  return(result)
}
show_tables <- function() {
  q = "SELECT name, type FROM sqlite_master WHERE type IN ('table', 'view')"
  return(run_query(q))
}
show_tables()
```

#### Comparing Genre Popularity

Chinook has recently acquired four new albums of different genres; a Hip-Hop album by
the group Regal, a Punk album by the band Red Tone, a Pop album from the artist
Meteor and the Girls, and a Blues album by Slim Jim Bites. We'll analyze how well various
genres have sold in the past to assess where Chinook should put its marketing money.
```{r warning=FALSE, comment=FALSE}
#this tells us the total tracks_sold is 1051 - the number we use to calculate percentage
#later on
percentage_query <-
  "SELECT
count(track.genre_id) 'tracks_sold',
genre.name 'genre_name'
from invoice_line
INNER JOIN track ON track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
INNER JOIN genre ON genre.genre_id = track.genre_id
INNER JOIN invoice ON invoice.invoice_id = invoice_line.invoice_id
INNER JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
WHERE customer.country == 'USA'
ORDER BY tracks_sold DESC"

run_query(percentage_query)

#assessing genres by sales in the US
genre_query <-
  "SELECT
count(track.genre_id) 'tracks_sold',
genre.name 'genre_name',
(CAST(COUNT(track.genre_id) AS FLOAT)/1051)*100 'percent_share'
from invoice_line
INNER JOIN track ON track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
INNER JOIN genre ON genre.genre_id = track.genre_id
INNER JOIN invoice ON invoice.invoice_id = invoice_line.invoice_id
INNER JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
WHERE customer.country == 'USA'
GROUP BY genre.name
ORDER BY tracks_sold DESC"

gq <- run_query(genre_query)
gq

gq %>%
  mutate(genre_name = fct_reorder(genre_name, tracks_sold)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=genre_name, y=tracks_sold)) +
  geom_col(fill="#f68060", alpha=.8, width=.8) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw()
```

Rock is by far the most popular genre for Chinook customers, so none of these album acquisitions
are really perfect for the Chinook audience. The data suggests it's best to focus marketing money
on the Punk album (the next best-selling genre), and the sales strategy should involve playing
up any rock-inspired sounds the other artists' work offers. 

___

#### Assessing Sales Support Staff

Next, we'll compare the amount in sales each Chinook sales support agent brings in, plus
other data relevant to their performance.
```{r warning=FALSE, comment=FALSE}
employee_query <- 
  "SELECT
  COUNT(customer.support_rep_id) 'rep_customers',
  employee.first_name || ' ' || employee.last_name 'employee_name',
  SUM(invoice.total) 'rep_total',
  employee.hire_date
  FROM customer
INNER JOIN employee ON employee.employee_id = customer.support_rep_id
INNER JOIN invoice ON invoice.customer_id = customer.customer_id
GROUP BY employee_name"

eq <- run_query(employee_query)
eq

eq_pal <- c("#f68060", "#C5C392", "#ADA7C9")

eq %>%
  ggplot(mapping =aes(x=employee_name, y=rep_total, fill=employee_name)) +
  geom_col(alpha=.8, width=.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=eq_pal) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

eq %>%
  ggplot(mapping =aes(x=employee_name, y=rep_customers, fill=employee_name)) +
  geom_col(alpha=.8, width=.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=eq_pal) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Jane Peacock has made the most money in sales so far, while Margaret Park has handled
the most individual clients. Steve lags in both categories, but he's also the newest sales agent at the company. Overall, there are no weak links here.

#### Analyzing Sales Data By Country

Now we'll analyze sales data by country through a variety of summary statistics. 
```{r warning=FALSE, comment=FALSE}
new_country <-

"
WITH country_fix AS
    (
    SELECT
    CASE
      WHEN 
      COUNT(DISTINCT customer.customer_id) = 1 THEN 'Other'
      ELSE customer.country
      END AS 'country',
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer.customer_id) 'total_customers',
    COUNT(DISTINCT invoice.invoice_id) 'total_orders',
    SUM(invoice.total) 'total_sales'
    FROM customer
    INNER JOIN invoice ON invoice.customer_id = customer.customer_id
    GROUP BY country
    ),
results AS
    (
    SELECT
    SUM(total_customers) 'number_customers',
    SUM(total_sales) 'total_sales',
    SUM(total_sales) / SUM(total_customers) 'value_per_customer',
    SUM(total_sales) / SUM(total_orders) 'avg_order_value',
    country
    FROM country_fix
    GROUP BY country
    ORDER BY number_customers DESC
    )

SELECT
number_customers,
total_sales,
value_per_customer,
avg_order_value,
country
FROM 
  (SELECT
  results.*,
  CASE
    WHEN results.country = 'Other' THEN 1
    ELSE 0
    END AS 'outer_sort'
  FROM results)
ORDER BY outer_sort
"

cq <- run_query(new_country)
cq

cq_pal <- c(Other = "#EC4E20", USA = "#f68060", Canada = "#F3CA40", Brazil = "#C5C392",
            France = "#285238", Germany = "#ADA7C9", "Czech Republic" = "#586994", 
            "United Kingdom" = "#ECDCB0", Portugal = "#D38B5D", India = "#F194B4")

cq %>%
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, total_sales)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=country, y=total_sales, fill=country)) +
  geom_col(alpha=.8, width=.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cq_pal) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_flip()

cq %>%
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country,value_per_customer)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=country, y=value_per_customer, fill=country)) +
  geom_col(alpha=.8, width=.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cq_pal) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_flip()

cq %>%
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, avg_order_value)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=country, y=avg_order_value, fill=country)) +
  geom_col(alpha=.8, width=.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cq_pal) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_flip()
```
___
The US makes up by far the most value in sales, while the Czech Republic has the biggest spenders
in terms of lifetime value per customer and value per order. Chinook should focus their expansion
on their loyal Czech customers, as well as emerging markets in Canada and Brazil. The 'Other' category, which collates all countries with less than one sale, is prominent in all three categories - so continuing to offer their services to a global audience should be an important
part of their strategy moving forward.

#### Breaking Down Purchases

Chinook is considering switching to selling invididual tracks only rather than albums
as a package, and want to know what share of their purchases are from sales of full albums
versus sales of collections of individual tracks.
```{r warning=FALSE, comment=FALSE}
rl_query <- 
  "
WITH 
album_count AS
(
  SELECT
  album_id,
  COUNT(track_id) 'album_tracks'
  FROM track
  GROUP BY album_id
  ),
  
album_lookup AS
(
  SELECT
  invoice_line.invoice_id,
  invoice_line.track_id,
  track.album_id
  FROM invoice_line
  LEFT JOIN track ON track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
  ),
  
purchase_count AS
  (
  SELECT invoice_id,
  album_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT track_id) 'count_purchased_tracks'
  FROM album_lookup
  GROUP BY invoice_id, album_id
  ),
  
compare_counts AS
  (
  SELECT purchase_count.*,
  album_count.album_tracks,
  (CASE
    WHEN purchase_count.count_purchased_tracks = album_count.album_tracks THEN 1
    WHEN purchase_count.count_purchased_tracks <> album_count.album_tracks THEN 0
    ELSE 9999
  END)
  as 'full_album'
  FROM purchase_count
  INNER JOIN album_count ON album_count.album_id = purchase_count.album_id),
  
classify_inv AS
  (
  SELECT invoice_id,
  MAX(full_album) 'album_purchase'
  FROM compare_counts
  GROUP BY invoice_id
  )
  
SELECT
album_purchase,
COUNT(invoice_id) 'number_of_invoices',
100*CAST(COUNT(invoice_id) AS FLOAT) / 
  (SELECT
  COUNT(invoice_id)
  FROM classify_inv) 'percent_purchases'

FROM classify_inv

GROUP BY album_purchase
  "

run_query(rl_query)
```
___
With 1 representing orders that included a full album and 0 representing purchases 
of collections of individual tracks, we can see that sales of albums makes up as much as
a third of Chinook's sales - switching to selling individual tracks doesn't seem compatible
with the purchasing style of Chinook's customer base. 

___

#### Exploring Playlist Composition

Chinook lets customers build playlists with their purchased music, and want to know which artists
and genres are best represented in the playlist system.
```{r warning=FALSE, comment=FALSE}
playlist_query <-
  "
SELECT
COUNT(playlist_track.track_id) 'playlist_inclusions',
track.composer,
genre.name
FROM
playlist_track
INNER JOIN track ON track.track_id = playlist_track.track_id
INNER JOIN genre ON genre.genre_id = track.genre_id
GROUP BY track.composer
ORDER BY playlist_inclusions DESC
LIMIT 10;
"

pq <- run_query(playlist_query)
# eliminating the #NA tracks - copies? imports? artistless songs?
pq %>%
  filter(playlist_inclusions < 200)
#graphing
pq_pal <- c("#EC4E20", "#f68060", "#F3CA40", "#C5C392",
            "#285238", "#ADA7C9", "#586994", "#ECDCB0", "#D38B5D", "#F194B4")

pq %>%
  filter(playlist_inclusions < 200) %>%
  mutate(composer = fct_reorder(composer,playlist_inclusions)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=composer, y=playlist_inclusions, fill= composer)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=pq_pal) +
  geom_col(alpha=.8, width=.8) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

g_query <-
  "SELECT
  COUNT(playlist_track.track_id) 'playlist_inclusions',
  genre.name
  FROM playlist_track
  INNER JOIN track ON track.track_id = playlist_track.track_id
  INNER JOIN genre ON genre.genre_id = track.genre_id
  GROUP BY genre.name
  ORDER BY playlist_inclusions DESC
  LIMIT 10;
"

ggq <- run_query(g_query)
ggq

ggq %>%
  mutate(name = fct_reorder(name,playlist_inclusions)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=name, y=playlist_inclusions, fill=name)) +
  geom_col(alpha=.8, width=.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=pq_pal) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Compared to the most popular genres in terms of purchases, this analysis of playlists has some surprises - even though Alternative/Punk is Chinook's second most popular genre in sales, Latin
and Metal make up the second and third most frequently used genres in Chinook playlists, perhaps thanks to Iron Maiden superfans and customers who listen to Latin acts Chico Science, Titas and Gilberto Gil. Iron Maiden frontman Steve Harris is by far the best represented artist in terms of sales, though U2 and the Rolling Stones are also very popular. A big portion of the database's playlist tracks don't have an assigned artist - 
a deeper exploration of why this is would add to the value of this analysis.

___

#### Conclusions

A globally accessible online purchasing system that supports sales of both individual tracks and full albums, as well as a high-performing team of sales support agents, are two of Chinook’s biggest strengths as a company, and should continue to be a focus moving forward. While Chinook has successfully built an international customer base of rock fans, the company should orient their future expansion towards their growing audiences in Canada, Brazil, and the Czech Republic. Users of the Chinook playlist system gravitate toward Metal and Latin genres, while Alternative & Punk is Chinook’s second most sold genre, so future album acquisitions and marketing should cater to these genres.
